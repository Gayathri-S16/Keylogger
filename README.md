# Keylogger
This system-integrated keylogger is designed to run silently in the background, capturing user keystrokes in real-time. It logs all keyboard input with precision, making it suitable for use in authorized system monitoring, debugging, or educational cybersecurity research. The tool supports configurable output options, allowing logs to be saved locally in text files or other formats for analysis. Built to operate efficiently with minimal system impact, it can be integrated into larger monitoring frameworks or used as a standalone utility. Its stealth mode ensures that it remains hidden from the user during operation, and its modular design allows for easy extension and customization.
